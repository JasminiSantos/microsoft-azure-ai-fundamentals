## Set Up Your Azure Machine Learning Workspace

Sign in to the Azure portal and create a new Machine Learning resource.
Once the resource is created, launch the Azure Machine Learning Studio from the overview page.

## Create a New Training Dataset

In Azure Machine Learning Studio, navigate to the 'Datasets' section and select 'Create dataset' -> 'From local files'.

Upload a sample dataset (e.g., a CSV file containing data for model training) and follow the prompts to configure the dataset settings.

## Prepare the Data:

Use the data preparation tools available in Azure Machine Learning Studio to clean and prepare your dataset for training. This may involve tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
